<!-- Replication reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects.  These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results.  These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection.  Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information. You will likely contact the authors of the original study, so this should be professional and forward facing. It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

This paper was one of the inspirations for my first year project. It includes a social implicit learning paradigm, which is what I am doing in my first year project. As the title of the paper suggests, it looks at social intuition, which is my central research interest. The study is also done in neurotypical participants but administers the autism quotient to look at correlations between autistic traits and other variables of interest. This makes the study more practical for an in class replication on a short timeline. I plan to get the face morphs used as stimuli for the replication in order to make this project much easier. I have some concerns about whether I will be able to get the stimuli since Leslie thinks someone else in our lab may have asked them for their stimuli and never got a response. If I cannot get the face stimuli, I will probably have to pivot, but I've sent out the email request and we'll see what happens. Another benefit of this study is that it doesn’t use any skills that are too far out of my reach, but still presents some opportunities for growth.

In the acquisition phase, face morphs of dynamic facial expressions (happy or angry) in which their gaze shifts towards or away from the participant will be shown to participants across multiple trials. All faces are either identity A or B. Identity A and B are showing either a positive or negative disposition towards the participant. In the test phase, implicit learning was tested via morphs of the facial expressions of both identities put together, progressively shifting towards more of one identity than the other, while participants indicated whether the identity was closer to A or B. The smiling and the frowning faces were tested separately. The idea was that if the participant had learned the disposition of the two identities, they would be able to indicate whether the face was more A or B. 

There is also a nonsocial task in which a circle and a square were used to denote identities A and B. Light blue was used instead of joy and dark blue was used instead of anger. A shift between the two blues served as a shift from joy to anger and vice versa. Additionally, a small red dot placed in the top right or bottom left of the shape and then moved was used in place of gaze direction. Other than the difference in stimuli, the acquisition and test phases were the same as in the social task.

*Bria and Jane, for all of the following please let me know if you think my conclusions are reasonable because I'm not confident about them at all.

The original study doesn't say how many trials they had, so I'm hoping that the author responds to my request for stimuli and I can ask how many trials they did. However, if I can't ask them, I would say maybe two blocks of 25 trials would be good. Typically on implicit learning paradigms, it takes about 200 trials for people to show marked improvement, but on this task the stimuli are very repetitive and limited with what seems like only 4 different videos displayed over the many trials. The authors are also critical of how many trials most nonsocial implicit learning paradigms take, saying that that isn't realistic to social life. Lastly, they express that too many trials will allow participants to learn the contingency while too few will not allow them to learn at all. These are the things that lead me to believe there may be the total number of trials might have been around 50. Additionally, the paper does not say what response if any they asked their participants to do in the learning phase, but they do mention what response participants had in the test phase. This leads me to believe that they had no response in the learning phase, which would again mean you can't have too many trials or participants will get far too bored. The response in the test phase will ask participants to press "f" or "j" to indicate that they think the face is more identity A or B after viewing the video clip on each trial. In the nonsocial task, participants will do the same thing except identities A and B are actually circle vs. square.

The test phase will be two blocks of 8 trials because it starts with 60% maximally smiling agent A and 40% maximally smiling agent B and progresses in steps of 5% towards 60% maximally smiling agent B, which only takes 4 trials. I'd like to give participants two rounds of the smiling trials. Then the same thing is repeated for the frowning faces, and I would give two rounds of that as well. Their accuracy scores in the test phase will serve as the measure of their implicit learning. At the end, participants will be asked questions probing whether they detected the contingencies in the experiment and if they did their data will be excluded. 

Ideally I will be able to get the face stimuli from the authors to get the closest replication. Then the remaining task is to code the experiment to run the face stimuli correctly. I would likely use jspsych for that, which I anticipate will pose slight challenges but nothing I can’t overcome, especially with the support offered in class. 

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

In this original experiment:
The effect size for the main effect of disposition in the nonsocial task was np^2 = 0.12.
The effect size of the main effect of proportion in the nonsocial task is np^2 = 0.35
The effect size of the main effect for object in the social task was np^2 = 0.39
The effect size of the main effect for proportion in the social task was np^2 = 0.2


### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
